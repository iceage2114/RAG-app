# Chatbot App Workspace

## Project Description
This workspace contains a multi-component chatbot application designed to provide interactive conversational experiences. The main goal is to enable users to chat with an AI-powered assistant through a modern web interface. The app can be used for answering questions, providing information, or assisting with various tasks, depending on the backend AI and data sources integrated.

The solution is split into two main React projects:
- **chatbot-app**: The primary chatbot interface and logic, which may include backend server integration.
- **chatbotclient**: A client-side application for interacting with the chatbot, which can be used as a standalone front-end or as a demo client.

Both projects are designed for easy setup, development, and deployment, making it simple to extend or adapt the chatbot for different use cases.

This workspace contains two main projects:

## 1. chatbot-app
A React-based chatbot application.

### Structure
- `src/` - Source code for the chatbot app
- `public/` - Static assets and HTML template
- `build/` - Production build output
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

### Key Files
- `App.js` - Main application component
- `ChatInterface.jsx` - Chat UI logic
- `Server.js` - Backend server (if present)

### Scripts
- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests

## 2. chatbotclient
A client-side React app, possibly for interacting with the chatbot backend.

### Structure
- `src/` - Source code for the client
- `public/` - Static assets and HTML template
- `build/` - Production build output
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

### Key Files
- `App.js` - Main application component
- `FetchButton.js` - Example component for fetching data

### Scripts
- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to either `chatbot-app` or `chatbotclient`.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Use `npm start` to launch the development server.

## Notes
- Both projects are React-based and use standard React scripts.
- The `build/` folders contain production-ready assets after running `npm run build`.
